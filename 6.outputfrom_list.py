x = ["apple", "banana", "tomato"]
print(x[0])  # Accesses and prints the first element of the list
print(x[1])  # Accesses and prints the second element of the list
print(x[2])  # Accesses and prints the third element of the list

# x[0] accesses the first element of the list, which is "apple".
# x[1] accesses the second element of the list, which is "banana".
# x[2] accesses the third element of the list, which is "tomato".

# 1. Elements
#    1. Elements: The individual items contained within the list.
#    2. Index: The position of each element within the list, starting from 0.
#    3. Length: The total number of elements in the list.

# The elements are the items within the list. In this example, "apple", "banana", and "tomato" are the elements of the list x.

# 2. Index
# Each element in the list has an index, which is its position within the list:
#     • x[0] is "apple"
#     • x[1] is "banana"
#     • x[2] is "tomato"

# 3. Length

# The length of a list is the number of elements it contains, which can be found using the len() function:
